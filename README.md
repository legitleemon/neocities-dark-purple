# Neocities Dark & Purple Stylesheet

I made this dark theme for Neocities because I hate light themes, they hurt my eyes. It's not perfect, but I'm uploading it in hopes that it'll be useful to someone.

I probably missed some elements, but as far as I can tell, most of the site is styled, with some exceptions like the HTML tutorial.

In the true spirit of Neocities, user websites aren't affected by this theme.

# Installation

Install an add-on such as [Stylus](https://add0n.com/stylus.html) or something else that lets you add custom stylesheets for websites. Head over to the [userstyles.world](https://userstyles.world/style/23742/neocities-dark-purple) page for the style and hit the Install button.

# License

This theme is released under [The Unlicense](https://unlicense.org/), a public domain license. You're free to do whatever you want with it, just don't yell at me if something doesn't quite work. I'm willing to help or make improvements though.
